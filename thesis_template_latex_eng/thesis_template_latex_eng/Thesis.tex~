Large scale text archives are increasingly becoming available on the Web. Exploring their evolving contents along both text and temporal dimensions enables us to realize their full potential. Standard keyword queries facilitate exploration along the text dimension only. Recently proposed \emph{time-travel keyword queries} enable query processing along both dimensions, but require the user to be aware of the exact time point of interest. This may be impractical if the user does not know the history of the query within the collection or is not familiar with the topic.

In this work, our aim is to \emph{efficiently identify interesting time points} in Web archives with an assumption that we receive a result list for a given query in standard relevance-order from an existing retrieval system. We consider two forms of Web archives: (i) one where documents have a publication time-stamp and never change (such as news archives), and (ii) the archives where documents undergo revisions, and are thus versioned. In both settings, we define interestingness as the change in top-k result set of two consecutive time-points. The key step in our solution is the maintenance of top-k results valid at each time-point of the archive, which can then be used to compute the interestingness scores for the time-points. We propose two techniques to realize efficient identification of interesting time points: (i) For the case when documents once published never change, we have a simple but effective technique. (ii) For the more general case with versioned documents, we develop an extension to the segment tree which makes it rank-aware and dynamic. To further improve efficiency, we propose an early termination technique which is proven to be very effective. Our methods are shown to be effective in efficiently finding interesting time points in a set of experiments using the New York Times news archive and the Wikipedia versioned archive.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisors Dr. Srikanta Bedathur and Klaus Berberich, for their invaluable guidance. Their views and advise was crucial in fruitful completion of my thesis. The discussions with them were always fruitful and insightful.

A special note of thanks to Prof. Gerhard Weikum for giving me the
opportunity to pursue this thesis under his supervision and for his valuable inputs.

I am very thankful to my friends and classmates for their company and moral support. I learnt a lot from them in last 2 years which is a very important factor for successful completion of my thesis.

Finally, I would like to thank IMPRS-CS for the assistance and financial support that I received from them.
